# project2

project2 is a collaborative endeavour and the culmination of the SMU Coding Boot Camp cirriculum up to this point. In an effort to combine the most concepts into a single application, we opted to create a Heroku hosted blog using Passport, MySQL, Travis, ESLint, Sequelize, Express, node.js, jQuery, Handlebars and Zomato API.

## About the Project

Our blog project utilizes multiple MySQL tables and location/buisiness data from the open source version of Zomato API. User sign-up, login and deletion are aided in facilitation through the use of Passport in which passwords are hashed, serialized, deserialized and authenticated. The data base is hosed via JawsDB in conjunction with the site being hosted on Heroku. The application sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity, so initial site renderings may be longer than usual. Currently our team is working on rendereding blogs to the user screen by further implementing Handlebars and improving our useage and visualization of the API data that is availble to us with the open source version of the API. Future Improvements of this application are friending other blog users, viewing other user blogs, creating favorites and five star rating short lists for each blogger as well as many more exciting ideas that are constantly being cultivated! Stay tuned for future improvements!
